# Chess
Fun 1 or 2 player chess game made in Java. 

Simply download the source code. The main function in order to operate the game is located within the Main package. 

The game defaults to two player mode, but may be modified to be run in one player mode as black or white. This code is quite ugly,
as this was a project I started when I was first learning about object oriented programming, and did not understand the 
necessesities for it, or when classes should be made; however, I am very proud to have made it. (especially the AI controlling the computer pieces).
